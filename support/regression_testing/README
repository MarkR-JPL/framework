This directory contains scripts used for regression testing purposes.

input_generation/ contains the scripts and configurations needed for
recreating the inputs for the regression tests in the format required
by the run scripts.

In addition, the scripts used to run the full set of tests are
included here in processing_scripts. These are copies of what are already
found in the regression data area, e.g.,
/groups/algorithm/l2_fp/regression_test/B2.08.00/

weekly_scripts/ contains scripts for use by buildbot to perform a
weekly regression test run.
