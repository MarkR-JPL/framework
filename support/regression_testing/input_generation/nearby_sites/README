Included here are scripts used to generate spliced input HDF5 files
used for regression testing with soundings close to certain defined
sites. The site_configs directory contains one definition file for
each site. The scripts under scripts/ use these config files for
directing spliced file production.

The assemble.sh script here uses these configs and scripts to produce
the files in the expected directory structure needed by the regression
setup and run scripts.
