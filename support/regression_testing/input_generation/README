This directory contains the scripts needed for recreating the inputs
for the L2 regression tests. Nominally this would only be done when
one wants to change the version of the SDOS files used as a basis or
to test that this process still works. 

input_config.sh contains variables used by the scripts defining which
SDOS and GOSAT versions of source files to use. Additionally it
defines the directory structure under which each dataset is placed.

The assembled files will be create according to the
OUTPUT_FILES_STRUCTURE variable under the current directory where the
script is run from. 

There are two data generation directories:
* nearby_sites - Older regression data based on distance to certain FTS sites
* regression_inputs - Latest regression data sets:
  - integration_test
  - quick_look
  - repeat_cycle
  - regression_test
    - valset_model
    - valset_tccon

Data is recreated by running the assemble.sh script from the directory where you 
want the generated files to be located.

Two directories exist where data provided by the scientists have been formatted
into HDF5 files which can be used in plotting for comparisons.
* quick_look_comparison
* valset_comparison
